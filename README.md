covert-radio
===========
A cli internet radio interface operating in the shadows.

Covert-radio allows you to listen to internet radio stations from your commandline, while staying out of your way. It runs completly in the background and is not bound to a specific window/terminal. You can control it one command at a time, from wherever you want. Mplayer is used to do most of the heavy lifting.

**Project goals**
* complete control from commandline
* runs in background, does not kidnap the window it is started in
* control commands can come from any terminal
* best possible auto-completion

### Dependencies

You will need to restart your terminal before auto-completion will work.
You can delete the repo after installation if you want.
